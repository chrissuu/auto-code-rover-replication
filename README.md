### AutoCodeRover Replication
Replication results from running AutoCodeRover replication with SWE-bench lite evaluation. We divided the work into two different sets: first 80 tasks of SWE-bench lite and the last 220 tasks of SWE-bench lite. 

You can find the logs in the folders logs_<split count> and evaluation json objects in acr_eval_<split count>.json
